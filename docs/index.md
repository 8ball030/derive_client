# Derive Client

The **Derive Client** is a comprehensive library for interacting with [Derive Protocol](https://derive.xyz) - a decentralized, self-custodial derivatives trading platform built on Ethereum.

## What is Derive?

Derive is a high-performance crypto trading platform offering options, perpetuals, and spot trading. The platform consists of:

- **Derive Chain**: An Optimistic rollup settlement layer built on the OP Stack, secured by Ethereum
- **Trading Engine**: High-performance matching engine for derivatives trading
- **Self-Custodial**: Users maintain full control of their funds through smart contract wallets

## Key Features

### **Multiple Client Types**

- **Sync Client**: HTTP-based REST API client for simple, blocking operations
- **Async Client**: Asynchronous HTTP REST API client for high-performance applications
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time client for streaming data and low-latency trading

### **Built-in Bridging**

- **Standard Bridge**: ETH bridging from Ethereum mainnet to Derive for gas fees
- **Derive Bridge**: Asset bridging using Socket Superbridge (WBTC, WETH, USDC, etc.) and LayerZero (DRV token)
- **Session Keys**: Secure delegation of trading permissions without compromising wallet security

### **Unified API**

All clients support the same core methods through Derive's JSON-RPC protocol, which works over both HTTP and WebSocket transports.
